# ssbc-owners

this is a script to easily add everyone to all repos.
if you are npm owner for the modules in the list,
you can run this and it will work.

`./run.sh add`

to add a module without rerunning the entire script, edit the script to add the module name to the list,
and then run:

`./run.sh add_module {module_name}`

to add all maintainers to that module.
